    Password Encryption:
        Each password should be encrypted individually using a strong symmetric encryption algorithm like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
        Avoid using the master password directly as the encryption key, as this could lead to security issues if an attacker gains access to the master password.
        Instead, generate a unique, random encryption key for each password and use that key to encrypt the respective password.
        Store the encrypted passwords along with their unique encryption keys.

    Master Password Handling:
        The master password should never be stored directly or in plain text.
        Use a secure key derivation function (KDF) like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2 to derive an encryption key from the master password.
        The KDF should be slow and computationally expensive to slow down brute-force attacks on the master password.

    Master Encryption Key:
        Once the encryption key is derived from the master password, use it to encrypt and decrypt the unique encryption keys of each password.
        The master encryption key should be kept in memory only while the password manager is actively used and should be discarded when the application is closed.

    Secure Storage:
        Ensure that the encrypted passwords and encryption keys are stored securely.
        You can use secure file storage or databases with access control mechanisms to protect the data.

    Secure Communication:
        If the password manager syncs data across devices or with a cloud server, ensure that all communication is encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS).

    Strong Authentication:
        Use strong authentication mechanisms to protect access to the password manager itself.
        Implement measures like multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.
